Several things I'd like to do:

+ Actual loading and registration of configuration, notification and task modules
    rather than just relying on loading things in the Helm::* namespace

+ Help command and help docs for each task

+ --remote-env options to set remote ENV variables?

+ --parallel flag so things can be done in parallel

+ --port option

+ --timeout option

+ --capture option which allows stdout, stderr, both, none

+ --compare option to compare outputs from the different servers
    in an intelligent manner
